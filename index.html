				        	<h3 class="title"> Breathalyzer Bracelet </h3>

							<img src="images/projects/bevyBand/logo.png" class="bevyLogo"/>

							<div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHYzN0zucWs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

							<h4> What is Bevy Band? </h4>

							<p> Nearly 10,000 people die annually because of drunk drivers and over 2,000 people
							die from alcohol poisoning in the US alone. Our product’s purpose is to decrease the amount
							of drunk drivers and to act as a tool for increasing responsible drinking. Our intention is to allow
							users to track their blood alcohol content (BAC) throughout their night. Users will also be able to
							see their friends blood alcohol levels to help look out for one another. By having this interactivity
							amongst a group, the intention is for your friends to look at your alcohol level and be able to alert
							you when or before you’ve had too much to drink and vice versa. Our product will consist of a
							wearable breathalyzer with an “At Glance” screen, and an Android Mobile Application where all information
							will be viewed and stored.  </p>

							<h4> How? </h4>
							<p> The two components of Bevy Band are the breathalyzer bracelet and an Android phone to run the Bevy Band app. This is illustrated below. </p>
							<img src="images/projects/bevyBand/How.png" class="bevyHow"/>

							<p> The development tools included the following: </p>

							<img src="images/projects/bevyBand/tools.png" class="bevyHow" />

							<p> The Adruino IDE was used to develop the software on the bracelet that we build out of Arduino parts and an Arduino Mini Pro board. Android Studio was used to build the Android App that connected to the bracelet through Bluetooth. Lastly, Firebase was used as a development helper - mostly to be able to log in with Facebook and connect with friends. </p>

							<h4> User Testing </h4>
							<h5> Drinking Habit Survey </h5>
							<p> The first user test was an online survey. We had 65 users respond and compiled the results which can be seen below: </p>

							<img src="images/projects/bevyBand/surveyResults.png" class="bevyHow" />

			 				<h5> Paper Prototype </h5>
			 				<p> The second user test was a paper prototype to test the flow of user interaction with the app. This allowed us to refine the main interactions on the application and test our design. </p>
			 
			 				<img src="images/projects/bevyBand/paperPrototype.jpg" class="bevyHow" />

			 				<h5> Medium Fidelity Prototype </h5>
			 				<p> The next user test let us test the functionality of the application using an android device. A link to the medium fidelity prototype can be found below. It was made using InVision and let us find problem areas before creating the app. </p>

			 				<a href="https://invis.io/NS67M51VZ" target="_blank" class="center"> Link to Medium Fidelity Prototype </a>

							<h4> Final Product </h4>

							<p> The video below shows the final product. We accomplished building a bracelet that is small and compact and we have the base functionality of the application working. This means communication between the bracelet and the application works as well as logging in with different Facebook profiles. There is still a lot of functionalities and design elements that we would like to improve and may continue working on this in the future. </p>

							<div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GJrsFZVaOws" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

							<h5> Bracelet </h5>
							<p> The bracelet went through many iterations. The bracelet has the breathalyzer (gas sensor), a Bluetooth chip and an OLED screen The final bracelet is shown below: </p>

							<img src="images/projects/bevyBand/bracelet.JPG" class="bevyHow" />

							<h5> Application </h5>
							<p> The app also went through many iterations. It does not match the original design because we focused on functionality with the time we had. We hope to improve the design and add the rest of the missing functionalities. The final app user profile is shown below: </p>

							<img src="images/projects/bevyBand/app.JPG" class="bevyHow" />


							<h4> Progress Website </h4>
							<p> Throughout the development of the app and bracelet we tracked our progress using a wordpress website. Each week has a short update that explains what we were doing that week. </p>

							<h4> Concept & Prototype </h4>
							<p> When coming up with a final project for our Sensor Based Interaction class, myself and 3 friends come up with the very broad idea of creating a Portal Turret. First we had to prototype and below are some of our primary ideas. </p>

							<p> Our first prototype was build using a wooden frame, two motors hooked up to an Arduino and motion tracking (body and face) using the Kinect. </p>

							<img src="images/projects/turretProject/prototype.JPG" class="fullWidth mrgn-lrg" />
							<img src="images/projects/turretProject/prototypeSketch.JPG" class="fullWidth mrgn-lrg" />

							<p> This is how we planned to move the chassis (inside of the turret) and how we would accomplish horizontal and vertical movements </p>

							<img src="images/projects/turretProject/mechanicalParts.JPG" class="fullWidth mrgn-lrg" />
							<img src="images/projects/turretProject/mechanicalParts3.JPG" class="fullWidth mrgn-lrg" />

							<p> With the Kinect we used the infared camera to track the head and chest of a person </p>

							<img src="images/projects/turretProject/prototypeTracking.JPG" class="fullWidth mrgn-lrg" /> 

							<h4> Features </h4>

							<p> Below are the features that we completed for the project: </p>

							<img src="images/projects/turretProject/features3.JPG" class="fullWidth mrgn-lrg" />

							<h4> Tools </h4>

							<p> The main tools that we decided to use to make the turret include the following: </p>

							<ul> 
								<li> Webcam </li>
								<li> Cinder Library (Visual Studio) </li>
								<li> Arduino (servo motors and lights) </li>
								<li> Lego Technic parts </li>		
								<li> 3D Printed Shell </li>
